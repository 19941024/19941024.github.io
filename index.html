				At the very beginning I have to say that I am not a native english speaker and I would really appreciate if you help me to fix my errs if you found any.
				as you might know; my name is Amir; I do not like any kind of prefix or suffix so please call me: Amir.
				If you look at the page, you will find it really simple because I am simple. I believe in simplicity.
				Actually I do my best effort to have the best performance and functionality on cli browsers not just yours.
				I can make butterflies to fly within the page, but I do not understand why should I do that. it's redicilous.

				Transparency is another topic that I like. it makes me leave the repository of this page open to anyone.
				community driven open source projects and web3 are the most ...
