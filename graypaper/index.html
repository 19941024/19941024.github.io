			<p id="intro">
			Hello world. I am going to write you some so you can know me; my thoughs.<br />
			I do know this might be a big mistake about/to my privacy.<br />
			that's not necessary but you can read it if you like. I don't care if you don't.<br />
			if you insist to waste your precious time reading my words. just follow along.
			</p>
			<p id="goal">
			In these words; I am going to write about things that I can't talk about easily.<br />
			I'm going to talk about the most important topics in my mind/life.<br />
			and I will let you know me some.
			</p>
			<p id="time">
			To me; time is the most important and precious thing that I have got.<br />
			I don't want to no waste mine and yours. so I try hard to keep my words shorter and clearer.
			</p>
			<p id="simplicity">
			You should have noticed the simplicity of this page.<br />
			honestly with some lines of code. I can do anything I want.<br />
			I can make a page full of bars; buttons; animations; etc.<br />
			but to me. they are all evil. because they will mislead the purpose of this page.<br /> 
			which is having you there reading it. and nothing else.
			</p>
			<p id="pow">
			I don't want to just talk, talk and talk.<br />
			just wanna show you something that I have done.<br />
			just wanna tell you how I think about them. and why I did so.
			</p>
			<p id="page">
			Let's talk about this page; not something beyond our reach.<br />
			something I made myself which represents my design and code characteristics.<br />
			I have written the code from scratch. I like to do so. it helps me keep things simple.<br />
			even though I didn't devote time to things that other developers do.<br />
			I devoted mine to research about adjusting the texts and colors to be more readable for you.<br />
			I hate bothering ads and anything that pops up. so I don't allow them to be in my page.<br />
			I don't often use mouse for navigation. so no buttons involved.<br />
			I won't use my own domains to show you we are in github's territory. cause I do care about your privacy.<br />
			I won't add dark mode to this page. because you can use your own browsers reader mode.<br />
			you can use reader modes to have even more personalized settings for your comfort.<br />
			I will not add complexity to my page for these silly things.<br />
			I just want to reach the goal with least resources devotion.
			</p>
			<p id="equality">
			my name is amir. no prefix or suffix. I don't like them.<br />
			they show we differ people. maybe I believe in equality.<br />
			can't say though because I don't know how you want to define "equality".<br />
			I just know even if there are differences between twins. we are all equal.
			</p>
			<p id="outro">
			this page is under development.
