			<p id="intro">
			hello world. I am going to write you some so you can know me.<br />
			that's not necessary but you can read it if you like. I don't care if you don't.<br />
			if you are going to waste your precious time reading my words. I must say:<br />
			people don't often understand me I hope you may.<br />
			</p>
			<p id="goal">
			you should have noticed the simplicity of this page.<br />	
			honestly with some lines of code. I can do anything you want on this page.<br />
			I can animate paper butterflies flying within the page.<br />
			but what would be the purpose of those bothering, ugly butterflies?<br />
			to me. they are all evil. because they will mislead the purpose of this page.<br /> 
			which is this piece of digital paper and having someone to read it.<br />
			</p>
			<p id="simplicity">
			
			</p>
			<p id="equality">
			my name is amir. no prefix or suffix. I hate them.<br />
			they show we differ people. maybe I believe in equality.<br />
			can't say though because I don't know how you want to define that.<br />
			I just know even if there are differences between twins. we are all equal.<br />
